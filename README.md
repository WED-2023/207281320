 About Me - A short bio.

 My Photos - Photos of the legendary Russian wrestler Aleksandr Karelin.

 My Playlist - An embedded YouTube video featuring a randomly selected song. 

 Give Me A Like - A Facebook like button to show support.

 ANS - Display of information in a tabular format comparing different web generations.
